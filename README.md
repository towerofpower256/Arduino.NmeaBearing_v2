# Arduino.NmeaBearing_v2

This is my 2nd attempt at creating an Arduino program to receive NMEA heading messages and display the heading on an LCD display.

The requirements for this one were to display the True and Magnetic bearings separately, and to also include the difference between them (compass error).
